Computer Vision for Cancer Cell Cycle Research

This Github contains the scripts and algorithms that were developed to implement [Convolutional U-Nets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) for fully automatic image analysis in cancer cell cycle research. The work was modeled on the double U-Net analysis pipeline used in the [DeLTA](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007673) analysis framework.
